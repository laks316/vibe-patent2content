Convert Patent PDFs to Simplefied Content (Vibe coded with Gemini 2.5 Pro)

# üìÑ Patent Insight Generator with AI Summary

This is a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload a Patent document in PDF format, view it within the browser, and generate an AI-powered executive summary using the Google Gemini API. It also provides sections for users to manually input key patent details and add their own analysis notes.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **PDF Upload:** Easily upload your Patent document in PDF format.
*   **Integrated PDF Viewer:** View the uploaded patent directly within the application interface.
*   **AI Executive Summary:** Generate a concise summary focusing on the technical problem solved, core invention, key features, and field of invention, powered by Google Gemini.
*   **Secure API Key Handling:** Uses Streamlit Secrets for securely managing your Gemini API key (specifically for cloud deployment).
*   **Manual Data Entry:** Sections to manually add patent number, title, inventors, assignee, dates, and other relevant details.
*   **User Notes Area:** A dedicated space for users to write their own analysis, key claim interpretations, or follow-up questions.

## ü§ñ AI Summarization Focus

The AI summary generated by the app aims to provide a technical overview of the patent, specifically targeting:

*   The problem the invention addresses.
*   The core technical solution or concept.
*   Key features or advantages of the invention.
*   The technical field of the invention.

This is designed to give a quick understanding of the patent's technical contribution.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This app is designed to be easily deployable on Streamlit Community Cloud. The API key is handled securely using Streamlit Secrets.

## üîë Prerequisites

Before you can run or deploy this app, you will need:

1.  **Python 3.8+:** The core programming language.
2.  **Pip:** Python's package installer (comes with Python).
3.  **A Google Gemini API Key:** Obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
4.  **Git and GitHub Account:** Necessary for deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud.
5.  **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows Only):** PyMuPDF might require this. Download the latest version from [Microsoft's official site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) (usually the x64 version). Install and restart your computer if you encounter DLL errors.

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub details).

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Ensure your `requirements.txt` file contains:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    google-generativeai
    PyMuPDF
    streamlit-pdf-viewer
    ```

## üîê API Key Setup (for Streamlit Cloud)

**DO NOT** put your API key directly into the code or commit a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file containing your key to GitHub.

When deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud:

1.  After connecting your GitHub repository, go to the "Advanced settings..." during deployment.
2.  In the "Secrets" text area, add your Gemini API key in the following format:

    ```toml
    GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
    ```
    Make sure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is spelled exactly like that.

The application code is written to automatically read this secret when deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Locally

1.  Follow the **Installation** steps above.
2.  Activate your virtual environment.
3.  If you want to test the AI summary locally, create a folder named `.streamlit` in your project's root directory (if it doesn't exist). Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml` and add your key like shown in the API Key Setup section above.
4.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_script_name.py
    ```
    (Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file, e.g., `app.py`).

The app will open in your default web browser.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  Once the app is running, use the file uploader in the sidebar to select a Patent PDF document.
2.  The PDF will load and display in the left panel.
3.  In the right panel, if your Gemini API key is configured correctly (either via local `secrets.toml` or on Streamlit Cloud), the "Generate Patent Summary" button will be enabled. Click it to generate the summary.
4.  The AI-generated summary will appear in the right panel.
5.  Use the "Patent Details (Manual)" and "User Notes / Analysis" expandable sections to add your own structured data and free-form notes related to the patent. This data is stored temporarily in your session.

## ü§î Limitations

*   AI summary accuracy depends heavily on the clarity and structure of the text within the PDF, and the capabilities of the Gemini model.
*   PDF text extraction might not be perfect, especially for scanned documents, complex tables, figures, or unusual layouts.
*   The AI primarily summarizes the description and background sections; it does not perform detailed claim analysis.
*   Manual data entry is required for patent details and notes.
*   No long-term storage of uploaded PDFs, summaries, or manual notes is implemented in this basic version (data persists only for the current session).

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

*   Automated extraction of basic patent metadata (number, title, dates, inventors).
*   More specific AI analysis (e.g., summarizing claims, identifying prior art mentions).
*   Ability to save/load manual data and notes.
*   Keyword search function within the displayed PDF text.
*   Integration with patent databases (e.g., USPTO, Espacenet APIs) for cross-referencing.
*   Improved handling of complex PDF layouts.
